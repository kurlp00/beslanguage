# beslanguage
Just a compiler design project. This language is based from C Language and uses Recursive Descent Parsing technique(adviced to me though I don't know if I really implemented it correctly. Haha.). Anyway this project was finished and has undergone the phases of compiler with some bugs/issues to be fixed. I just want to upload it here for memories and resources. :( Hahaha. So hard to English.

## Some issues

- Some lexical analyzer issues regarding wrong variable name format
- Wrong error messages
- Some variable scoping errors
- I added some symbol table fields that are not used
- Some interpretation errors
- And more undiscovered or undocumented bugs

Feel free to to report issues.

:D
